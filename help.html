            What is an appropriate length for a Wikipedia article? This is discussed at Article length.<br>
             An article can be as long as 10,000 words or more, if there are enough<br> sources on the topic to provide for that much content
             . Undoubtedly there are articles <br>that reach 20,000 words. The recommended maximum length is around 100kB of text.
